# What are data structures?

Perhaps you have had a conversation with someone quite verbose and refined, someone that uses intricate vocabulary
when talking about something, and then you go home, and open one of those dictionaries that could be perfectly usable
bricks, and you try to find the words that this person said in your conversation. You might already know that
dictionaries are sorted in alphabetical order, so you just go to that section where the word should be, and there it is.

Because the dictionary is sorted in alphabetical order, it was pretty straightforward to find that desired word, but,
let's think for a second that the dictionary was not sorted in alphabetical order, but by the length of the words. Now
is isn't that easy to find that word, isn't it?

Because the way that we structure information is key to turn a paramount task to a simple one, it is important to know
this interesting concept called data structures.

In this repository, I'll be learning Data Structures as I write notes for anyone learning too :)
