	<summary><h3>Lesson 1. Introduction to pointers</h3></summary>
	1. <b>RAM (Random Access Memory):</b> The primary memory of a computer that is used for storing and retrieving data quickly. It is oftened likened to a big array of bytes.
	<br>
	<br>
	2. <b>Bytes:</b> Basic units of information storage in computer storage, consisting of eight binary digits.
	<br>
	<br>
	3. <b>Address:</b> A unique identifier assigned to each byte in memory, allowing the system to locate and access that specific byte.
	<br>
	<br>
	4. <b>Data Type:</b> Specifies the type of data a variable can hold and the operations that can be performed on it. Examples include int (integer) and float (floating-point number).
	<br>
	<br>
	5. <b>Variable:</b> A named storage location in memory whose value can be modified during program execution.
	<br>
	<br>
	6. <b>Pointer:</b> A variable that stores the memory address of another variable. It is denoted with an asterisk (*) before its name.
	<br>
	<br>
	7. <b>Dereferencing:</b> Accessing or manipulating the data stored in the memory location pointed to by a pointer. Denoted by using the asterisk (*) before the pointer's name.
	<br>
	<br>
	8. <b>Reference:</b> A way to refer or point to the data stored in a variable, including its memory address and data type.
	<br>
	<br>
	9. <b>Initialization:</b> Assigning an initial value to a variable, ensuring it has a valid value before use.
	<br>
	<br>
	10. <b>Garbage Values:</b> Unpredictable or undefined values that may be present in a variable if it is not properly initialized.
	<br>
	<br>
	11. <b>Reference (in programming):</b> In computer programming, a reference is a way to access the data stored in a specific memory location. Dereferencing involves manipulating this data.
