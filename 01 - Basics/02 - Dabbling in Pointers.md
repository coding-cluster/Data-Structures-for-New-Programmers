# <p align="center">Dabbling in pointers</p>
**Welcome Back!** In this lesson, we are actually coding something interesting with pointers! But first, we need to learn stuff that
can make it easier for us to build our first pointers program.

## <p align="center">Dereference and Variable Manipulation</p>

There is a gazillion of ways in which you can manipulate variables with pointers, but hold on, because as simple as it seems, it can get
quite tricky when manipulating more complex variables. In this case, we will begin with something simple. Do you remember the code snippet
that was used in the first lesson? Well, we will play a bit with it ðŸ‘€.

So, open your IDE of preference, perhaps you like VSCode, or CLion, and be sure that everything is properly set up.

> [!WARNING]
> When wrongly used, pointers can get a bit hostile, so be sure to use them properly. Otherwise, they can cause some real damage in your
> computer. Beware of the risks when you make more intricate software.
