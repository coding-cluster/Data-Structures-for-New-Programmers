# What are Data Structures?

Perhaps you have had a conversation with someone quite verbose and refined, someone who uses intricate vocabulary when talking about something. Then, when you go home and open one of those dictionaries that could be perfectly usable bricks, you try to find the words that this person said in your conversation. You might already know that dictionaries are sorted in alphabetical order, so you just go to that section where the word should be, and there it is.

Because the dictionary is sorted in alphabetical order, it was pretty straightforward to find that desired word. However, let's think for a second that the dictionary was not sorted in alphabetical order but by the length of the words. Now, it isn't that easy to find that word, is it?

Since the way we structure information is key to turning a paramount task into a simple one, understanding this interesting concept called data structures becomes important.

In this repository, I'll be learning Data Structures as I write notes for anyone learning too :)
